# 🌟 OSS Contribute

[OSS Contribute](https://osscontribute.com/) is a website I built to help developers like me find the best open-source projects to contribute to. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, finding the right project to contribute to can be challenging—this tool simplifies that process.

## 🔍 How It Works

OSS Contribute searches for projects based on the following criteria to ensure you find active and meaningful projects to work on:

- 📝 Open Source: Must be a public project with an open-source license.
- 📈 Active Development: Must not be archived, ensuring the project is still actively maintained.
- 🤝 Contribution-Friendly: Must have at least 10 issues labeled with `good first issue` or `help wanted` to help you get started.
- ⭐ Popular Projects: Must have at least 500 stars on GitHub—highlighting community trust and interest.
- 🕒 Recently Updated: Must have been updated within the last month to ensure it's actively worked on.
